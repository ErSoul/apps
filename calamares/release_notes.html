    <h3>KaOS - 2016.03</h3>KaOS is proud to announce the availability of the March 
    release of a new stable ISO.  <br/>
    The Plasma Desktop includes Frameworks 5.20.0, Plasma 5.5.5 and KDE Applications 15.12.2. 
    A few enhancements to the Plasma 5 experience have been added, these are KaOS specific extras.
    You now have the option to calculate the md5sum from any file from the Dolphin service menu. 
    Since the kf5 move there has not been a fully working GUI for user management, 
    there is one added now for KaOS, you will find it under systemsettings, account details. 
    From there you can create new users, change existing user(s) role or delete a user. 
    Also added it is a KCM for locale/language settings.<br/>
    Most notable major updates to the base of the system  are a Glibc 2.23/Binutils 2.26 based new toolchain, 
    a move of the xorg stack to 1.18, gstreamer group is at 1.6.3, a move to Pacman 5, Linux 4.4.4,
    Mesa 11.1.2, Pulseaudio 8.0 and Mariadb 10.1.12<br/>
    
    The artwork received a redesign in many elements. A new icon theme for light and dark themes has arrived. 
    The Midna Dark theme received a complete overhaul with a new plasma theme, window decorations, 
    colorscheme and new sddm & splash themes. The new work brings to Midna Dark a complete unified look.<br/>
    
    This ISO uses the <b>CRC and finobt enabled</b> XFS filesystem as default.  
    CRCs enable enhanced error detection due to hardware issues, whilst the format 
    changes also improves crash recovery 
    algorithms and the ability  of  various  tools to validate and repair metadata
    corruptions when they are found.  The  free  inode  btree does not index used inodes, 
    allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems age.<br/>
    <br/>
    
    KaOS specific settings for kinit make it possible to start a Plasma Wayland session
    right from the login manager.  An X11 session is of course still default, but the drop-down
    menu has a wayland entry too.  With Plasma 5.5, the Wayland session is now possible on more systems. <br/><br/>
    
    This ISO KaOS uses the Systemd provided Systemd-boot for UEFI installs, 
    Gummiboot is depreciated. <br/> 
    Among the new applications that are now fully ported to Qt5/Frameworks 5, 
    Kjots, Keneric, Kcolorchooser, SqliteBrowser and Kbibtex.
    <b>Calamares, the used installer framework</b>, has moved to the 2.1 series.
    Highlights of the changes and additions:

    <ul>
        <li>Thoroughly rewritten partitioning feature, now based on KPMcore 
        (the same library used by KDE Partition Manager)</li>

        <li>The choice page in the partitioning module now shows disk changes in
        real life, with much improved preview widgets, which are now not just 
        preview but also selection widgets for the Replace feature</li>

        <li>Tooltips in partition views.</li>

        <li>All new non-blocking asynchronous device rescans with spinner UI throughout 
        the partitioning module</li>

        <li>Added support for setting partition flags (including the EFI system partition flag) 
        while creating or editing a partition in the manual partitioning page.</li>

        <li>Overhauled modules system, allowing for much more flexibility in configuring
        and arranging views and jobs.</li>

        <li>Added a check and warning when installing in EFI mode with manual partitioning 
        without setting up a mount point and/or flag for the EFI system partition.</li>
    </ul><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system
    maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like
    making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the
    pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info
    of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very
    simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in
    Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for
    the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some
    recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in
    tool to access <b>KCP</b> https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages
    has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own "foreign" icon in
    the menu-bar. When viewing package info it is now possible to click the
    depends of such a package. <br/>
    For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple,
    transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader. This ISO
    presents XFS as the default filesystem option for KaOS. To learn more about
    the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <b>http://kaosx.us/</b>, 
    <b>http://kaosx.us/about/</b> and
    <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/</b> pages. <br/>
    To avoid any misunderstanding
    and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b>
    any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build
    entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this
    see <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/#Isn8217t_KaOS_just_another_Arch_based_distribution</b>.<br/><br/>
    
    A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every
    ISO is mere a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea
    what is currently available: The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.20.0,
    Plasma 5.5.5, KDE Applications 15.12.2 & not yet released ports of KDE
    Applications</b>, Linux 4.4.5, Systemd 229, Kmod 22, Networkmanager 1.0.10,
    Calligra 3.0Alpha, Clementine, Plasma-nm 5.5.5, Xorg-server 1.18.1, Mesa
    11.1.2, Glibc 2.23, GCC 4.9.3, non-free Nvidia 361.28 and Python3 3.5.1 to
    name a few. The package manager is <strong>Pacman 5.0.1</strong>, with the
    simple but powerful Octopi 0.8.1 as GUI frontend. Default webbrowser is
    Qt based Qupzilla 1.8.9. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork,
    Grub theme is Midna, Look & Feel is a KaOS exclusive version "Midna",
    fully redone for 2016. <b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay
    limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about
    2100-2200. A gist of what is available, beside the stable kernel there is
    Linux-next 4.5, Libreoffice 5.1.1, Qt 5.5.1, bumblebee packages, VLC,
    Vokoscreen, Blender, XBMC, Calibre, Sigil, Librecad, a few games like 0ad
    and Knights. A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are
    available, examples Firefox 45.0, Chrome 50, Ardour 4.7.0, Flashplugin
    11.2.202.577, Inkscape 0.91, GIMP 2.8.14 and Google-talkplugin 5.38.5.0.
    Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox,
    Libreoffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9.1 is available as a rather
    complete group. <b>Known issues:</b>

    <ul>
        <li>If you want to use a GPT partition table on a BIOS system, make
        sure to set it up following <b>http://kaosx.us/gpt-partitioning/</b>, 
            the installer's partitioner can
            only handle GPT correctly for UEFI
        </li>
        <li>Installing on RAID, LVM, LUKS is currently not possible</li>
    </ul>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the
    instructions from the <b>http://kaosx.us/download/</b>
    page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin</b>, and DVDs need a burn
    speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.<br>
