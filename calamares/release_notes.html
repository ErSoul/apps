    <h3>KaOS - 2015.09</h3>It is with great pleasure to present to you the
    <b>2015.09 ISO</b>. 
    As always with this rolling distribution you will find the very latest
    packages for the Plasma Desktop, this includes Frameworks 5.14.0, Plasma 5.4.1 
    and KDE Applications 15.08.1.<br/>
    Bigger news though are two changes.  This ISO is the first time that the default
    XFS filesystem is <b>CRC and finobt enabled</b>.  CRCs enable enhanced error detection 
    due to hardware issues, whilst the format changes also improves crash recovery 
    algorithms and the ability  of  various  tools to validate and repair metadata
    corruptions when they are found.  The  free  inode  btree does not index used inodes, 
    allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems age.<br/>
    Second is not so much an enhancement for the user, but vital for this distribution, 
    the addition of a License Approval page to the installer.  Since KaOS ships with the option
    to install with proprietary graphics drivers, users accepting the EULA for such drivers
    was sorely needed.<br/><br/>
    
    Changes to SDDM, kwin and kinit make it now possible to start a Plasma Wayland session
    right from the login manager.  An X11 session is of course still default, but the drop-down
    menu has now a wayland entry too.  The default web-browser Qupzilla is one of the 
    first applications that heavily relied on X11 in its code that now is fully 
    ported to run a Wayland session too. <br/><br/>
    
    Most notable major updates over the last six weeks are the Ncurses 6.0 stack, 
    OpenCV 3.0.0 stack, Xfsprogs 4.2.0, grub 2.02beta, Networkmanager packages 
    moved to 1.0.6 and Systemd 226. 
    This ISO KaOS uses the Systemd provided Systemd-boot for UEFI installs, 
    Gummiboot is depreciated. <br/> 
    Many more applications are now fully ported to Qt5/Frameworks 5, examples of 
    the recent ports are Sweeper, KRFB, ksuperkey, Basket and Lyx.
    <b>Calamares, the used installer framework</b>, has received a
    lot of work. Highlights of the additions:

    <ul>
        <li>An all new WebView module, which allows the deployer to show any 
        web page in a WebKit environment.</li>

        <li>An all new License module, which allows the deployer to require
        acceptance of licensing terms for proprietary components</li>

        <li>Enhanced autologin defaults customization.</li>

        <li>Swap partition support in automatic partitioning</li>

        <li>Support for blacklisting modules at build time.</li>

        <li>Service disabling support in the Services module.</li>

        <li>Several bug fixes in the partitioning component.</li>
    </ul><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system
    maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like
    making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the
    pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info
    of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very
    simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in
    Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for
    the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some
    recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in
    tool to access <b>KCP</b> https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages
    has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own "foreign" icon in
    the menu-bar. When viewing package info it is now possible to click the
    depends of such a package. <br/>
    For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple,
    transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader. This ISO
    presents XFS as the default filesystem option for KaOS. To learn more about
    the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <b>http://kaosx.us/</b>, 
    <b>http://kaosx.us/about/</b> and
    <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/</b> pages. <br/>
    To avoid any misunderstanding
    and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b>
    any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build
    entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this
    see <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/#Isn8217t_KaOS_just_another_Arch_based_distribution</b>.<br/><br/>
    
    A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every
    ISO is mere a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea
    what is currently available: The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.14.0,
    Plasma 5.4.1, KDE Applications 15.08.1 & not yet released ports of KDE
    Applications</b>, Linux 4.1.5, Systemd 226, Kmod 21, Networkmanager 1.0.6,
    Calligra 3.0Alpha, Clementine, Plasma-nm 5.4.1, Xorg-server 1.17.2, Mesa
    11.0.1, Glibc 2.21, GCC 4.9.4, non-free Nvidia 352.41 and Python3 3.4.3 to
    name a few. The package manager is <strong>Pacman 4.2.1</strong>, with the
    simple but powerful Octopi 0.8.0dev as GUI frontend. Default webbrowser is
    Qt based Qupzilla 1.8.6.1. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork,
    Grub theme is monochrome, Look & Feel is a KaOS exclusive version "Midna",
    fully redone since the Plasma 5 move. <b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay
    limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about
    2100-2200. A gist of what is available, beside the stable kernel there is
    Linux-next 4.2, Libreoffice 5.0.1, Qt 5.5.0, bumblebee packages, VLC,
    Vokoscreen, Blender, XBMC, Calibre, Sigil, Librecad, a few games like 0ad
    and Knights. A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are
    available, examples Firefox 40.0.3, Chrome 47, Ardour 4.1.0, Flashplugin
    11.2.202.508, Inkscape 0.91, GIMP 2.8.14 and Google-talkplugin 5.38.5.0.
    Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox,
    Libreoffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9 is available as a rather
    complete group. <b>Known issues:</b>

    <ul>
        <li>If you want to use a GPT partition table on a BIOS system, make
        sure to set it up following <b>http://kaosx.us/gpt-partitioning/</b>, 
            the installer's partitioner can
            only handle GPT correctly for UEFI
        </li>

        <li>Installing on RAID, LVM, LUKS is currently not possible</li>
    </ul>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the
    instructions from the <b>http://kaosx.us/download/</b>
    page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin</b>, and DVDs need a burn
    speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.<br>
