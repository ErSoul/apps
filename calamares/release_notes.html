    <h3>KaOS - 2015.08</h3>It is with great pleasure to present to you the
    <b>2015.08 ISO</b>. This ISO brings a long list of wonderful improvements
    to all of KDE. Biggest part undoubtedly is the first time to have the
    option to run Plasma 5 in a Wayland session. It still is in an early stage
    so kwin_x11 is of course the default still. KaOS is also approaching a
    completed switch from Qt 4 to Qt 5 only. This ISO has only one application
    left that depends on Qt 4, hplip, The repositories have about a dozen left
    that still need Qt 4. Most notable major updates over the last two months
    are the Xorg 1.17 stack, Glib2 2.44.2 stack, Qt 5.50, GCC 4.9.3, Linux
    4.1.5 and Systemd 224. This ISO KaOS uses the Systemd provided Systemd-boot
    for UEFI installs, Gummiboot is depreciated. As for the desktop this ISO
    brings all the latest of Plasma 5 (<strong>Frameworks 5.13.0, Plasma
    5.4RC1</strong>) and <strong>KDE Applications 15.07.90</strong>. All build
    on Qt 5.5.0. Plasma-volume-control is now part of the Plasma 5 group,
    renamed to Plasma-pa (for sound plasmoid). Many more applications are now
    fully ported to Qt5/Frameworks 5, examples of the recent ports are
    Megaglest, Tellico, KMahjongg, lmms, smb4k, qmmp, Basket and Lyx.
    <b>Calamares, the used installer framework</b>, has received a
    lot of work. Highlights of the additions:

    <ul>
        <li>Added the option of not installing a boot loader on MBR (legacy
        BIOS boot) systems.</li>

        <li>Added the option of changing the file system type when editing a
        partition.</li>

        <li>More robust partition detection and mounting/unmounting</li>

        <li>Swap partition support in automatic partitioning</li>

        <li>Fixed an issue which could result in the wrong mount point being
        set for a swap partition</li>

        <li>Adjusted the Install page so that the QML slideshow is loaded and
        started exactly when the install operation starts</li>

        <li>Improved branding mechanism, with distribution branding option on
        the Welcome page</li>
    </ul><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system
    maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like
    making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the
    pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info
    of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very
    simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in
    Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for
    the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some
    recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in
    tool to access <b>KCP</b> https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages
    has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own "foreign" icon in
    the menu-bar. When viewing package info it is now possible to click the
    depends of such a package. For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple,
    transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader. This ISO
    presents XFS as the default filesystem option for KaOS. To learn more about
    the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <b>http://kaosx.us/</b>, 
    <b>http://kaosx.us/about/</b> and
    <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/</b> pages. To avoid any misunderstanding
    and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b>
    any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build
    entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this
    see <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/#Isn8217t_KaOS_just_another_Arch_based_distribution</b>.
    A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every
    ISO is mere a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea
    what is currently available: The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.13.0,
    Plasma 5.4RC, KDE Applications 15.07.90 & not yet released ports of KDE
    Applications</b>, Linux 4.1.5, Systemd 224, Kmod 21, Networkmanager 1.0.4,
    Calligra 3.0Alpha, Clementine, Plasma-nm 5.4, Xorg-server 1.17.2, Mesa
    10.6.4, Glibc 2.21, GCC 4.9.4, non-free Nvidia 352.30 and Python3 3.4.3 to
    name a few. The package manager is <strong>Pacman 4.2.1</strong>, with the
    simple but powerful Octopi 0.8.0dev as GUI frontend. Default webbrowser is
    Qt based Qupzilla 1.8.6.1. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork,
    Grub theme is monochrome, Look & Feel is a KaOS exclusive version "Midna",
    fully redone since the Plasma 5 move. <b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay
    limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about
    2100-2200. A gist of what is available, beside the stable kernel there is
    Linux-next 4.1, Libreoffice 5.0.0, Qt 5.5.0, bumblebee packages, VLC,
    Vokoscreen, Blender, XBMC, Calibre, Sigil, Librecad, a few games like 0ad
    and Knights. A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are
    available, examples Firefox 40.0, Chrome 46, Ardour 4.1.0, Flashplugin
    11.2.202.508, Inkscape 0.91, GIMP 2.8.14 and Google-talkplugin 5.38.5.0.
    Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox,
    Libreoffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9 is available as a rather
    complete group. <b>Known issues:</b>

    <ul>
        <li>If you want to use a GPT partition table on a BIOS system, make
        sure to set it up following <b>http://kaosx.us/gpt-partitioning/</b>, 
            the installer's partitioner can
            only handle GPT correctly for UEFI
        </li>

        <li>Installing on RAID, LVM, LUKS is currently not possible</li>
    </ul>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the
    instructions from the <b>http://kaosx.us/download/</b>
    page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin</b>, and DVDs need a burn
    speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.<br>
