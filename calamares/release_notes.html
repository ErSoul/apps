    <h3>KaOS - 2016.04</h3>Not the customary bi-monthly release this time, but celebrating the
    three year anniversary of KaOS by releasing 2016.04.  Reason for this earlier release
    is the move to Qt 5.6 and with that an update and/or rebuild of the complete Desktop<br/>
    QtWebengine has now replaced QtWebkit as the base for the default web-browser <b>Qupzilla</b>
    You will find a much better multimedia experience, were full-screen video is now supported, 
    sites like Vimeo just work and there is no longer a need to use the unmaintained 
    since 2012 flashplugin. Pepperflash is fully compatible with new Qupzilla 2.0</br>
    The Plasma Desktop includes Frameworks 5.21.0, <b>Plasma 5.6.2</b> and KDE Applications 16.04.0<br/>
    Most notable major updates to the base of the system  are Boost 1.60.0, ICU 57.1, Xorg-server 1.18.3, 
    gstreamer group is at 1.8.0, Libarchive 3.2RC, Alsa packages moved to 1.1.1, Linux 4.4.5,
    Mesa 11.2.0, Pulseaudio 8.0 and Mariadb 10.1.12<br/>
    Some KDE applications look like they might not make the kf5 migration. One such app is kget, 
    it was partially ported, but all work on it has stalled for too long to keep it an option for KaOS. 
    A new and very complete download manager has replaced kget. Fatrat will be part of KaOS 
    default installs from now on.  Another change is the move to Cantata as the default Music Manager,
    Clementine's focus is still on developing for Qt 4 plus has security issues which new Sqlite tried
    to avoid.  Cantata is fully Qt 5 ported and very well integrated in the Plasma 5 desktop.
    
    The artwork received a redesign in many elements. A new icon theme for light and dark themes has arrived. 
    The Midna Dark theme received a complete overhaul with a new plasma theme, window decorations, 
    colorscheme and new sddm & splash themes. The new work brings to Midna Dark a complete unified look.<br/>
    
    This ISO uses the <b>CRC and finobt enabled</b> XFS filesystem as default.  
    CRCs enable enhanced error detection due to hardware issues, whilst the format 
    changes also improves crash recovery 
    algorithms and the ability  of  various  tools to validate and repair metadata
    corruptions when they are found.  The  free  inode  btree does not index used inodes, 
    allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems age.<br/>
    <br/>
    
    KaOS specific settings for kinit make it possible to start a Plasma Wayland session
    right from the login manager.  An X11 session is of course still default, but the drop-down
    menu has a wayland entry too.  With Plasma 5.6, the Wayland session is now possible on more systems. <br/><br/>
    
    This ISO KaOS uses the Systemd provided Systemd-boot for UEFI installs, 
    Gummiboot is depreciated. <br/> 
    Among the new applications that are now fully ported to Qt5/Frameworks 5, 
    Kjots, Keneric, Kcolorchooser, SqliteBrowser and Kbibtex.
    <b>Calamares, the used installer framework</b>, has moved to the 2.1 series.
    Highlights of the changes and additions:

    <ul>
        <li>Full support for NVME SSDs</li>

        <li>Replaced QtWebKit with QtWebEngine in webview module if building with Qt 5.6 or greater;</li>

        <li>Tooltips in partition views.</li>

        <li>Automated Breakpad and GDB-based crash reporting with libcrashreporter-qt</li>

        <li>Added much deserved credit for translators in About dialog.</li>

        <li>Support for “replacing” free space</li>

        <li>Added a check and warning when installing in EFI mode with manual partitioning 
        without setting up a mount point and/or flag for the EFI system partition.</li>
    </ul><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system
    maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like
    making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the
    pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info
    of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very
    simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in
    Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for
    the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some
    recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in
    tool to access <b>KCP</b> https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages
    has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own "foreign" icon in
    the menu-bar. When viewing package info it is now possible to click the
    depends of such a package. <br/>
    For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple,
    transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader. This ISO
    presents XFS as the default filesystem option for KaOS. To learn more about
    the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <b>http://kaosx.us/</b>, 
    <b>http://kaosx.us/about/</b> and
    <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/</b> pages. <br/>
    To avoid any misunderstanding
    and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b>
    any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build
    entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this
    see <b>https://kaosx.us/faq/#KaOS_is_NOT_another_Arch_based_distribution_right</b>.<br/><br/>
    
    A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every
    ISO is mere a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea
    what is currently available: The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.21.0,
    Plasma 5.6.2, KDE Applications 16.04.0 & not yet released ports of KDE
    Applications</b>, Linux 4.4.5, Systemd 229, Kmod 22, Networkmanager 1.0.12,
    Calligra 3.0Alpha, Cantata, Plasma-nm 5.6.2, Xorg-server 1.18.3, Mesa
    11.2.0, Glibc 2.23, GCC 4.9.3, non-free Nvidia 364.12, Pepperflash and Python3 3.5.1 to
    name a few. The package manager is <strong>Pacman 5.0.1</strong>, with the
    simple but powerful Octopi 0.9dev as GUI frontend. Default webbrowser is
    Qt based Qupzilla 2.0.0. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork,
    Grub theme is Midna, Look & Feel is a KaOS exclusive version "Midna",
    fully redone for 2016. <b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay
    limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about
    2100-2200. A gist of what is available, beside the stable kernel there is
    Linux-next 4.5, Libreoffice 5.1.2, Qt 5.6.0, bumblebee packages, VLC,
    Vokoscreen, Blender, XBMC, Calibre, Sigil, Librecad, a few games like 0ad
    and Knights. A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are
    available, examples Firefox 45.0.2, Chrome 51, Ardour 4.7.0, Inkscape 0.91, 
    GIMP 2.8.14 and Google-talkplugin 5.38.5.0.
    Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox,
    Libreoffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9.1 is available as a rather
    complete group. <b>Known issues:</b>

    <ul>
        <li>If you want to use a GPT partition table on a BIOS system, make
        sure to set it up following <b>http://kaosx.us/gpt-partitioning/</b>, 
            the installer's partitioner can
            only handle GPT correctly for UEFI
        </li>
        <li>Installing on RAID, LVM, LUKS is currently not possible</li>
    </ul>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the
    instructions from the <b>http://kaosx.us/download/</b>
    page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin</b>, and DVDs need a burn
    speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.<br>
