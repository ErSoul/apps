    <h3>KaOS - 2016.01</h3>It is with great pleasure to present to you a first 
    KaOS ISO for 2016. <br/>
    As always with this rolling distribution you will find the very latest
    packages for the Plasma Desktop, this includes Frameworks 5.18.0, Plasma 5.5.3 
    and KDE Applications 15.12.1.  Plasma 5.5 has brought new features in the Widget Explorer, 
    expanded options in the Applications Launchers, new widgets including Color Picker & Disk Quota,
    restored support for legacy system tray icons, default font has moved to Noto and
    and Desktop Tweaks for different handling of widgets plus option to disable the desktop toolbox.
    Among the new Applications in 15.12 are Spectacle, the new screenshot capture program.
    Many more are now fully ported to Frameworks 5 and are part of the stable tar release in their
    frameworks version.<br/>
    Most notable major updates to the base of the system  are a Glibc 2.22 based new toolchain, 
    a move of python 3 to 3.5, GRUB updated with the the latest security fixes, Ruby 2.3.0 stack, Linux 4.3.3,
    Mesa 11.1.0 and LLVM/Clang moved to 3.7.1<br/>
    
    The artwork received a complete overhaul for 2016.  It is back to the original simple gray look as was used when KaOS started in 2013.  Work has gone into integrating all parts for one complete uniform look.  You now will see one continous theme starting with the grub bootloader to the logout screen.<br/>
    
    This ISO uses the <b>CRC and finobt enabled</b> XFS filesystem as default.  
    CRCs enable enhanced error detection due to hardware issues, whilst the format 
    changes also improves crash recovery 
    algorithms and the ability  of  various  tools to validate and repair metadata
    corruptions when they are found.  The  free  inode  btree does not index used inodes, 
    allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems age.<br/>
    <br/>
    
    KaOS specific settings for kinit make it possible to start a Plasma Wayland session
    right from the login manager.  An X11 session is of course still default, but the drop-down
    menu has a wayland entry too.  With Plasma 5.5, the Wayland session is now possible on more systems. <br/><br/>
    
    This ISO KaOS uses the Systemd provided Systemd-boot for UEFI installs, 
    Gummiboot is depreciated. <br/> 
    Among the new applications that are now fully ported to Qt5/Frameworks 5, 
    Rosegarden, Doxygen, Genymotion, Ktorrent, Kwave and Kbibtex.
    <b>Calamares, the used installer framework</b>, has moved to the 2.0 series.
    Highlights of the changes and additions:

    <ul>
        <li>Calamares no longer uses an internal version of partitionmanager,
        instead it now uses the libraries provided by KPMCore</li>

        <li>The choice page in the partitioning module now shows disk changes in
        real life, with much improved preview widgets, which are now not just 
        preview but also selection widgets for the Replace feature</li>

        <li>Tooltips in partition views.</li>

        <li>All new non-blocking asynchronous device rescans with spinner UI throughout 
        the partitioning module</li>

        <li>Many improvements in the manual partitioning interface (including rescans and selection).</li>

        <li>Fixed Replace operation on an extended partition.</li>

        <li>Several bug fixes in the partitioning component.</li>
    </ul><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system
    maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like
    making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the
    pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info
    of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very
    simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in
    Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for
    the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some
    recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in
    tool to access <b>KCP</b> https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages
    has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own "foreign" icon in
    the menu-bar. When viewing package info it is now possible to click the
    depends of such a package. <br/>
    For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple,
    transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader. This ISO
    presents XFS as the default filesystem option for KaOS. To learn more about
    the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <b>http://kaosx.us/</b>, 
    <b>http://kaosx.us/about/</b> and
    <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/</b> pages. <br/>
    To avoid any misunderstanding
    and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b>
    any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build
    entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this
    see <b>http://kaosx.us/faq/#Isn8217t_KaOS_just_another_Arch_based_distribution</b>.<br/><br/>
    
    A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every
    ISO is mere a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea
    what is currently available: The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.18.0,
    Plasma 5.5.3, KDE Applications 15.12.1 & not yet released ports of KDE
    Applications</b>, Linux 4.3.3, Systemd 228, Kmod 22, Networkmanager 1.0.10,
    Calligra 3.0Alpha, Clementine, Plasma-nm 5.5.3, Xorg-server 1.17.4, Mesa
    11.1.0, Glibc 2.22, GCC 4.9.3, non-free Nvidia 358.16 and Python3 3.5.1 to
    name a few. The package manager is <strong>Pacman 4.2.1</strong>, with the
    simple but powerful Octopi 0.8.0 as GUI frontend. Default webbrowser is
    Qt based Qupzilla 1.8.9. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork,
    Grub theme is Midna, Look & Feel is a KaOS exclusive version "Midna",
    fully redone for 2016. <b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay
    limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about
    2100-2200. A gist of what is available, beside the stable kernel there is
    Linux-next 4.4, Libreoffice 5.0.4, Qt 5.5.1, bumblebee packages, VLC,
    Vokoscreen, Blender, XBMC, Calibre, Sigil, Librecad, a few games like 0ad
    and Knights. A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are
    available, examples Firefox 43.0.2, Chrome 49, Ardour 4.4.0, Flashplugin
    11.2.202.559, Inkscape 0.91, GIMP 2.8.14 and Google-talkplugin 5.38.5.0.
    Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox,
    Libreoffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9.1 is available as a rather
    complete group. <b>Known issues:</b>

    <ul>
        <li>When using the Manual partitioning, the GUI hangs when the install starts.
        Clicking on the installer will move it forward to the installation page.
        This does not effect the actual install, and when finished it moves
        properly forward to the finish page</li>
        <li>If you want to use a GPT partition table on a BIOS system, make
        sure to set it up following <b>http://kaosx.us/gpt-partitioning/</b>, 
            the installer's partitioner can
            only handle GPT correctly for UEFI
        </li>
        <li>Installing on RAID, LVM, LUKS is currently not possible</li>
    </ul>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the
    instructions from the <b>http://kaosx.us/download/</b>
    page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin</b>, and DVDs need a burn
    speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.<br>
