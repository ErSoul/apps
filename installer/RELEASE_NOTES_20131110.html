        <h3>KaOS - 2013.11</h3>
        <hr width="100%">
        After about eight months of working in relative obscurity, it is a pleasure to announce a <b>first public release</b> of KaOS.  Initially started for a local group of small business owners, who had a clear vision of what was wanted for their ideal distribution.  Since all has been working well and stable, plus the fact that KaOS has been discovered by some opensource enthusiast who spread the word about this distribution quite quickly, it was decided not to keep this as a private distribution only.<br>
        To learn more about the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <a href="http://kaosx.us/">Home</a> page, <a href="http://kaosx.us/about/">About</a> and <a href="http://kaosx.us/faq/">FAQ</a><br>
        <br>
        A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every ISO is mere a snapshot of the current status of the repositories.  An idea what is currently available:
        <br><br>        
        The ISO ships with <b>KDE 4.11.3</b>, Linux 3.11.7, Systemd 108, Kmod 15, Networkmanager 0.9.8.8, Calligra 2.7.4, Clementine 1.2.0, Plasma-nm 0.9.3.1, Xorg-server 1.14.4, Mesa 9.2.2, Glibc 2.17 and GCC 4.8.2, non-free Nvidia 325.15 to name a few.<br>
        The package manager is <b>Pacman 4.1.2</b>, with the simple but powerful Octopi 0.3.0 as GUI frontend.  Default webbrowser is Qt based Qupzilla 1.5.0.
        <br><b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork, Grub theme is monochrome, plasma theme is an exclusive version of Kotonaru.</br>
        <br>
        <b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay limited in size and contain 1800-1900 packages currently.  Expect it to grow to a maximimum of about 2100-2200. An idea of what is available, beside the stable kernel there is Linux-next 3.12.0, Libreoffice 4.1.2, Qt 5.1, bumblebee packages, VLC, Vokoscreen, Blender, XBMC, Calibre, Sigil, Librecada, a few games like 0ad and Knights.<br>
        A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are available, examples Firefox 25.0, Chrome 32, Ardour 3.5, Flashplugin 11.2.202, Inkscape 0.48.4, GIMP 2.8.8 and Google-talkplugin 4.8.3.0.
        Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox, Libreoffice and Thunderbird.
        <br><br>
        The <b>Installer</b> is easy to use, stable, but is somewhat limited in features you'd expect from a modern installer<br>
        <br>
        To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the instructions from the <a href="http://kaosx.us/download/">Download</a> page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin</b>, and DVDs need a burn speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.</br>
